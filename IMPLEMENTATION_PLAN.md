# Regulatory Reporting Automation - Implementation Plan

## Architecture Decision: Hybrid Agent/Service Approach

### Components That SHOULD Use Agents (High Cognitive Tasks):

1. **Regulatory Interpreter Agent** (Order 5) ✅
   - Parses and interprets complex regulatory texts
   - Maintains contextual understanding of rules
   - Tracks regulatory changes over time
   - Reasons about ambiguous requirements

2. **Data Validation Agent** (Order 4) ✅
   - Detects anomalies using pattern recognition
   - Learns from historical errors
   - Suggests intelligent corrections
   - Adapts validation rules based on outcomes

3. **Compliance Monitor Agent** (Order 6) ✅
   - Predicts compliance risks
   - Monitors trends across submissions
   - Proactive deadline management
   - Strategic compliance recommendations

### Components That DON'T Need Agents (Deterministic Tasks):

1. **Report Generator** (Service) ❌
   - Template-based generation is deterministic
   - Format conversion is straightforward
   - No learning or adaptation needed

2. **Rule Engine** (Service) ❌
   - Rule application is deterministic
   - Version control is structural
   - No cognitive reasoning required

3. **API Integration** (Service) ❌
   - Standard REST/SOAP calls
   - Fixed integration patterns
   - No intelligent decision-making

## Build Order

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Now)
1. Set up FastAPI server structure
2. Create database models
3. Implement basic authentication
4. Set up Docker configuration

### Phase 2: Agent Implementation (Next)
1. Create base agent classes inheriting from Project Chimera's cognitive base
2. Implement Regulatory Interpreter Agent
3. Implement Data Validation Agent
4. Implement Compliance Monitor Agent

### Phase 3: Service Layer
1. Build deterministic rule engine
2. Create report generation service
3. Implement API integrations

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
1. Connect agents with services
2. Create end-to-end workflows
3. Build compliance dashboard
4. Comprehensive testing

## Agent Integration with Project Chimera

The agents will:
- Inherit from `operating_system/core/agents/cognitive_base.py`
- Register with DONNA for orchestration
- Use shared Redis for state management
- Integrate with existing monitoring systems

## Why This Hybrid Approach?

1. **Efficiency**: Don't over-engineer simple tasks
2. **Performance**: Agents have overhead; use only where intelligence adds value
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation between intelligent and deterministic components
4. **Scalability**: Services scale easier than agents for high-volume tasks
5. **Cost**: Agents consume more resources; optimize usage

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Start building
cd /Volumes/project_chimera/projects/regulatory-reporting-automation

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the FastAPI server
python src/main.py

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v
```
