# PROMPT LOG - Regulatory Reporting Automation

## Project Creation
**Date**: 2025-08-13 16:25:25
**Prompt**: Create a regulatory reporting automation MVP that automates the process of preparing and submitting reports required by regulators. AI helps interpret complex rules, checks data for errors, and generates reports, saving time and reducing the risk of mistakes. Create a process flow map and call out where AI is integrated. Make sure to create all the standard project documents.

**Actions Taken**:
1. Created complete project structure following Project Chimera standards
2. Implemented core deliverables:
   - API Integration for data sources and regulatory portals
   - Data Pipeline with validation and transformation
   - ML Models for anomaly detection, NLP parsing, and compliance prediction
   - Monitoring system for tracking and alerts
   - Rule Engine for regulatory requirement interpretation
   - Report Generator supporting multiple formats
   - Compliance Dashboard for real-time monitoring
3. Created comprehensive documentation
4. Set up testing framework
5. Configured regulatory rules and templates

**AI Integration Points**:
1. Data Validation - ML anomaly detection
2. Error Analysis - AI correction suggestions
3. Rule Parser - NLP interpretation of regulations
4. Compliance Check - AI verification
5. Gap Analysis - AI identifies missing data
6. Format Optimizer - AI ensures proper formatting

**Next Steps**:
- Integrate with real regulatory APIs
- Train ML models on historical data
- Deploy to production environment
- Add user interface
