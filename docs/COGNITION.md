# Cognitive Architecture - Regulatory Reporting Automation

## Overview

This document describes the cognitive architecture and AI agent assignments for the Regulatory Reporting Automation system.

## Cognitive Orders

### Order 6: Compliance Monitor Agent
**Purpose**: Predictive compliance analysis and risk assessment
- Monitors regulatory changes
- Predicts compliance risks
- Recommends proactive actions
- Learns from historical patterns

### Order 5: Regulatory Interpreter Agent  
**Purpose**: Complex regulatory text interpretation
- Parses legal documents using NLP
- Extracts requirements and deadlines
- Maps regulations to data fields
- Handles ambiguous language

### Order 4: Data Validation Agent
**Purpose**: Intelligent data quality assessment
- Detects anomalies using ML
- Identifies data patterns
- Suggests corrections
- Learns from validation history

### Order 3: Report Generation Agent
**Purpose**: Structured report creation
- Applies templates
- Formats data correctly
- Ensures compliance
- Optimizes for submission

## Agent Interactions

```
Regulatory Updates → Interpreter Agent → Rule Database
                                            ↓
Raw Data → Validation Agent → Clean Data → Report Agent → Formatted Report
     ↓                              ↑                            ↓
   Errors → Correction Engine ------+                    Submission Gateway
                                                                ↓
                        Monitor Agent ← Compliance Status ← Confirmation
```

## Learning Mechanisms

### Interpreter Agent Learning
- Builds corpus of regulatory interpretations
- Improves parsing accuracy over time
- Identifies common regulatory patterns

### Validation Agent Learning
- Learns normal data patterns
- Improves anomaly detection
- Reduces false positives

### Monitor Agent Learning
- Predicts deadline risks
- Identifies compliance trends
- Optimizes resource allocation
